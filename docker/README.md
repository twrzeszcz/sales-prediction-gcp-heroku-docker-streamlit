# Docker deployment
Docker app is modified with respect to the one deployed on the Heroku and GCP. Apart of the API where one can manually type in all the features, there is a second API added to read single lines from the **test.json** file and output them and third API which makes a prediction on the chosen entry (row) from the test file.
